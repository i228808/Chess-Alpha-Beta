Bitboard utilities for Strong Chess AI.

This module provides helper functions to efficiently extract and compute various chess features using bitboards.
The functions included are:
  - count_bits: Counts the number of set bits in a bitboard.
  - squares_in_mask: Returns a list of squares (0-63) in a bitboard.
  - file_mask: Return the bitmask for an entire file (a-h).
  - rank_mask: Return the bitmask for an entire rank (1-8).
  - bitboard_to_array: Convert a bitboard into an 8x8 numpy boolean array.
